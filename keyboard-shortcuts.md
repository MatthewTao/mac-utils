# Keyboard shortcuts

Here are some of the commonly used keyboard shortcuts.

## Text Control

Start/End of a word `option + left` or `option + right`

Start or end of a line `command + left/right`

There's no equivalent of windows delete, only backspace.

## Window Control

Hmmm hahaha I don't think Mac is too friendly for this. It seems designed for the touch pad to be used a fair bit after all.

For Mac there are applications, `command + tab` cycles through applications.

Within applications there can be multiple windows.

cycle through windows ``command + ` ``

Within each window there can be tabs. Cycling through tabs can be done through `control + tab`
